### Microsoft's Intro Into The Movie Production Business
By Eduardo Osorio, Henry Alpert

## The Project
Microsoft is interested in creating a movie studio needs a better understanding 
of the industry. They need information to help them decide what type of movies 
they should invest in.

## Sources Used
* The Internet Movie Database (IMDB)

* The Movie Database (TMDB)

* Box Office Mojo


## Summery of the Results 
Based on popularity, enthusiasm, and profitability. Microsoft should focus on 
producing these types of movies first.
* Action
* Adventure
* Comedy 
* Fantasy
We also recommend that Microsoft spends $100 million to $200 million on 
production budgets. Since the data shows that movies are most profitable in that
range.

## The Data
The data collect gave us information on popularity and profitability of movies 
with in the last ten years.

## How was profitability was measured?
Profitability was measured by taking the sum of the domestic gross and foreign 
gross of each movie, Then subtracting the production budget. 

## The Competition
If Microsoft is interested in creating a movie studio. They need to know who 
their top competitors are. As a new studio they might need to do collaborations 
with other more established studios in order to make a name for themselves.

# The Top 5 most profitable studios are:

Studio | Total Production Budget | Profitability
--- | --- | ---
**BV** | $5,161,200,000 | $18,447,901,369
**Fox** | $2,087,000,000 | $8,754,500,000
**WB** | $2,453,000,000 | $8,449,700,000
**Uni.** | $1,084,000,000 | $8,305,501,019
**Sony** | $1,440,000,000 | $5,425,600,000

Here is a graph showing the correlation between production budget and 
profitability.

The graph suggests that movies with higher production budgets are more profitable.
However, according to the data, movies with a production budget between $100 million
and $200 million are the most profitable.

## Genre Annual Trends
Genre popularity has changed over the years. With the data provided, we graphed 
genre trends from the last ten years

According to these trends, the genres that are currently gaining popularity are
the following: 
* Action
* Adventure
* Animation
* Biography
* Comedy
* Fantasy 
* Sport
* Thriller
* War

In order to slim down this list, we graphed the total profitability of these genres 
with in the last ten years.

With this graph were able to see which genres are the most profitable which are 
as follows:
* Adventure
* Action
* Comedy
* Sci-fi
* Drama

## Domestic VS Foreign Markets 

When producing a film the studio has to appeal to both domestic and foreign 
markets. If a studio makes a film aimed at one more then the other, Then
there is a strong possibility that the fill will lose out on revenues.

This chart shows us how foreign Gross compares to domestic gross for the top the
most profitable studios. In most cases foreign gross is substantially more then 
domestic.

## Recommendations

Our recommendations to Microsoft is that they invest in action, adventure, comedy,
and fantasy movies. Since these are the movies in the spotlight right now.
They should spend no more then $200 million for their production budget in order 
to remain profitable. Finally, they need to appeal to foreign audiences. Perhaps 
by including actors, writers and directors from other 
nationalities.

## Next steps

As we conducted our investigation, we noticed that there were considerable amount
of movies with very low production budgets that were still substantially profitable. 
With more time, it would have been interesting to map out the movies with Production
budgets between $1 million and $ 50 million along with their respective genres.
This would allow us to see which genres are more profitable at low budgets.
